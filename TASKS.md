# Tasks

This is Godot Director's own work queue, for developing the framework itself. It is fed by [Director-Driven Development](https://github.com/Freakling/Director-Driven-Development)'s orchestrator through pull requests. `project/TASKS.md` is a different file: the template shipped to adopters, which never receives these items.

Item format: `framework/.godot-director/tasks.md`. Queue order is priority; reorder by moving items.

**Next IDs:** T2 · B1

## Queue

### T1 · One commit model: a single task pauses for approval, a run commits without pausing · done · M · agent
- Touches: framework/.godot-director/procedures/next-task.md, framework/.godot-director/rules.md, framework/.claude/settings.json, framework/.claude/skills/next-task/SKILL.md, README.md, examples/scenarios.md, CHANGELOG.md
- Done when: `next-task.md` step 7 pauses for approval unless the human asked for a run ("grab tasks until you're blocked", "work through the queue", "the next N tasks"), and Several items also stops when the human declines a commit (check) · `git commit` is in `permissions.allow` and not in `permissions.ask` of `.claude/settings.json`, while `git push` still asks (check) · `rules.md`, the skill description, the README and the scenarios agree (check)
- GDD: (none)
- Source: Director-Driven-Development T35 (the shared commit model)
