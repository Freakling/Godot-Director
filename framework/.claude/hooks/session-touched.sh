# Godot Director session record · Claude Code hook · framework-owned: replaced on upgrade.
#
# The Stop hook (stop-check.sh) runs the project check at the end of a turn only for a session that wrote or
# edited a code, scene or data file itself since its last passing check. Two sessions can share one working
# folder, and one session's uncommitted code must not make the other, which edited only documentation, wait for
# the check. This hook keeps the record: .godot/godot-director/sessions/<session_id>.touched, one path from the
# project root per line. A file is source when it is a .gd, .tscn, .scn, .tres, .res, .gdshader or .gdshaderinc
# file or the project's project.godot (the Stop hook's own list); Markdown, design/, TASKS.md and assets such as
# .png are not. The hook runs in three places (settings.json), told apart by its argument:
#   after   PostToolUse on Edit, Write, MultiEdit and NotebookEdit: records the file the tool wrote, when it is
#           source and inside the project.
#   before  PreToolUse on Bash and PowerShell: saves what `git status` lists as changed source in
#           .godot/godot-director/sessions/<session_id>.before; the file's own modification time is the moment.
#   after   PostToolUse and PostToolUseFailure on Bash and PowerShell: records the source files that are new in
#           git's list, or that changed since the moment (one find -newer for all of them, not a process per file).
# No session_id in the input (an older Claude Code) records nothing, and the Stop hook then behaves as it did.
# Subagents report their parent's session_id, so a builder's edits count for the session that started it.
# GODOT_DIRECTOR_STOP_CHECK=0 turns it off with the Stop hook. It never blocks: every path ends in exit 0. Bash 3.2
# and BSD tools run it, and it starts as few processes as it can (git and find, once each, for a command).
