# Godot Director git guard · Claude Code PreToolUse hook on Bash, Monitor and PowerShell · framework-owned: replaced on upgrade.
#
# Permission rules match how a command starts, so `git commit -m x --no-verify` or
# `git push origin main --force` would slip past them. This hook looks at the whole command and
# blocks what .godot-director/rules.md › Git reserves for the human: rewriting history, discarding work,
# and getting around the hooks. It pattern-matches the text, so it's a strong safety net, not a
# guarantee. It starts no other processes (it runs on every Bash, Monitor and PowerShell call).
# The B numbers below are Director-Driven Development's bug IDs, where each reading was first fixed.
#
# settings.json lets `git restore <file>` and `git checkout -- <file>` run without a prompt, so this
# hook is what keeps the whole-tree forms with the human: a pathspec of the whole tree (., ./, ./., .\, :/,
# *, :(top), quoted or not), --pathspec-from-file, and a `git restore` that names no file.
#
# It also blocks the commands that hang or run past five minutes (a Python that reads its script from a heredoc, a Python with nothing to run (B66),
# an unbounded wait loop, a Godot run without `timeout`, a sleep over 280 seconds); see "Hangs" below.
#
# It also blocks shell reads, Bash or PowerShell, of the credential stores (the SSH folder, git's credentials
# files, the gh CLI's config folders) and the commands that print a stored credential (gh auth token, gh auth
# status -t, git credential fill or get). In Bash an escaped space in a store path (GitHub\ CLI) is a space, and an
# ANSI-C string ($'...') in a reader's or a path's name is the text it spells (B52). See "Credential stores" below.
#
# It also blocks the git flags that write a file, read a file outside the repository or run a
# configured command (--output, --no-index, --ext-diff, commit -F and --file), because the allow
# rules in settings.json let `git diff *`, `git log *`, `git show *` and `git commit *` run with
# any flag. See the section "git: flags that write a file" below.
#
# That section also reads git branch and git worktree per command, so the ways to discard a branch's
# commits or a worktree's uncommitted changes stay with the human in every spelling (branch -D, -d with
# a force, -M, -C; worktree remove --force; worktree add -B), and it blocks an unquoted brace expansion
# or $IFS in a git command, which could spell a flag past the parsing. A prototype's worktree is removed
# with `git worktree remove` and its branch deleted by the human (.godot-director/procedures/prototype.md).
# It reads git push the same way, so --mirror, --delete, -d and a :ref refspec, which overwrite or delete
# the remote's refs, stay with the human too (B39).
#
# A command substitution ($(...), `...`, <(...), >(...); PowerShell's $(...), @(...) and (...)) runs a command the
# guard can't see, and what it prints is text the rules can't read (B32). In a git command's words it can be a flag, and
# as a command's name it can be git. So the substitutions are read out of the command, each one's text is read as a
# command of its own, and in a git command's words only a double-quoted one that starts with fixed text (or a commit's
# or tag's -m value) passes, and only when its text is a plain read. In Bash a comment holds no substitution, and its quotes
# open no string (B43). See the section "Substitutions" below. The word decoder reads each comment on its own line, so a quote
# in a comment pairs with nothing after the line break, and a quoted flag or refspec after it is read (B51). See "Comments".
#
# A quoted script given to a shell or an interpreter (bash -c, sh -c, zsh -c, eval, powershell -Command, pwsh -c, cmd /c)
# is a command of its own: each is read as one, and a script nested in one to four levels too (B34). See the section
# "Shell wrappers" below. A wait loop in such a script is judged too, and a script under timeout 280 or less is bounded (B42).
# The hang check also reads a C-style for ((...)) loop, PowerShell's do { } while or until, Start-Sleep, cmd's timeout /t, and a
# command's substitutions, which run before a timeout above them starts, so the timeout doesn't bound them (B49). A PowerShell
# command's $(...) is read the same way, for the hang check and the credential-read check (B52).
# The hang rules read the command without the bodies no shell runs (B50): a commit's, tag's or gh message, and a cat or tee
# body nothing runs, are left out, so a message can name a loop, a pause or a timed wait.
# A shell or PowerShell name starts a script anywhere except right after a word that only prints its words (echo, printf,
# Write-Output, Write-Host, write): `echo PowerShell 'x'` is text, and `ssh host pwsh -c 'x'` is still read (B48).
#
# A variable in a git command's words holds a value the guard can't read (B37). A variable that the command assigns once,
# to a plain value, is read as that value (FLAG=--force; git push $FLAG is git push --force). Any other variable in the words
# of a git subcommand whose flags the rules read is blocked when it's unquoted, or quoted where a flag or a path could be; a
# variable as the subcommand, and a variable as a command's name followed by -c or -Command, are blocked too. See the
# section "Variables" below.
#
# A variable as a command's name runs what it holds (B45). A plain value the command assigns is that name (G=git; $G push
# --force is git push --force). Otherwise it's blocked when the command sets a variable the guard can't resolve, or when a git
# subcommand or a destructive flag follows it; "$PY" -I script.py passes, and so does G=$(cat tools/godot_bin.local) before
# timeout 120 "$G" --headless (the Godot path tools/setup-clone.sh saves, read as $GODOT_BIN is). A shell's script, eval's argument
# or -Command that holds a variable or a substitution is blocked, since the shell expands it before the guard can read it. See
# "A variable as a command's name".
# A PowerShell assignment ($x = 1, $x += 1, $env:X = 'y'), a constant ($true, $false, $null) or an automatic value ($_, $args) that
# no call operator (& or .) runs is no command name, and a Bash NAME+=value is an assignment prefix (B55).
#
# PowerShell's Invoke-Expression (iex) runs its one string argument as a script, as eval does (B60). That argument is read as a
# script of its own, and a variable the command assigns once to a plain literal before the call is read as its value. A pipeline
# into it, no argument, or an expression or a second argument the guard can't read is blocked. See "Invoke-Expression" below.
#
# A git -c key, or --config-env, that names a program git runs (an alias that starts with !, core.pager, core.sshCommand,
# diff.external, a credential helper) runs a command of the caller's choice, so the keys are an allow list: only the keys that
# run nothing pass, and a key a variable holds is blocked (B38). The flags that name a program for a remote (--upload-pack,
# --receive-pack, --exec, and clone's -u) are blocked on fetch, pull, push, clone, ls-remote and archive, abbreviations too. A
# variable that names a program git runs (GIT_CONFIG_*, GIT_SSH_COMMAND, GIT_PAGER, EDITOR and the like) set on a git command is
# blocked. See the section "Git configuration and program flags" below.
#
# The git name is read as the shell reads it, quotes removed, so "git", 'git' and g"it" are git (B39), in any case too:
# PowerShell finds a command case-insensitively, and Windows finds GIT, so GIT and Git are git (B46). Only the name is
# matched so: git's subcommands and flags stay case-sensitive, as git reads them, and the name is written [Gg][Ii][Tt].
# A path before it or .exe after it (/usr/bin/git, git.exe) is git too.
# A command name written as a path is read as its last part too: a quoted path with a space in it, or an unquoted backslash path
# that starts with a drive, ., .., ~ or two backslashes (C:\Git\bin\git.exe push --force). See "Command names that are paths" below.
# A heredoc body a shell runs (any body but a message, B40 and B48) takes a backtick as the end of a flag, and its words and the file-writing flags
# are read there too; git branch with a delete and a force flag, git push --mirror, --delete and -d, and a :ref refspec are
# blocked, and the credential-print rules read the decoded words (B39, where the git rules below read the bodies and the words).
# A heredoc body that no shell runs is text (B40, B48): a commit's or tag's message, a gh pr, issue or release message with a quoted
# delimiter (its body from stdin, --body-file -, -F -, --notes-file -, or from a $(cat <<'EOF') given to --body, -b, --notes or -n), and
# a cat or tee body that the command doesn't run (no shell, interpreter, ssh, chmod, make or npm, call operator, ./ path, dot-source or
# .git folder names it). The destructive rules, the file-writing flag rules, the variable rules (B37) and the hang rules (B50) skip
# such a body; the substitutions in it are still read (B32).

# --- Variables (B37) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A variable in a git command's words holds a value the guard can't read, and that value can be a flag (git push $FLAG
# with FLAG=--force) or a path outside the repository. var_resolve first replaces each variable the command assigns once,
# to a plain value (letters, digits and - _ . / : = + @ % , ~), with that value wherever it's used, as the shell expands
# it, so the rules above judge what git gets. A name set another way (read, for, +=), set twice, or to any other value
# stays a variable. var_judge then judges each variable left in a git command's words, and in a body a shell runs: an
# unquoted one is blocked, since the shell splits it into several words, and a quoted one is blocked where its value could
# be a flag or a path. It passes as the value of an option that takes the next word whole (-m, -e, -b, -C and the like),
# after -- (paths), as a push's branch after its remote, and after fixed text that doesn't start a flag ("ddd/bundle-$day",
# "--since=$since"). A variable as the subcommand is blocked. Only the subcommands in vb_scope are judged: those whose flags a
# rule reads (--output, -F, -O, -D and the like). A variable in another subcommand's words, such as git status or git add,
# passes, since no rule reads the flags they take.

# key from an environment variable, and clone takes -c and --config after its subcommand too. So a key passes only when it runs
# nothing (cfg_ok), and a key that a variable or a substitution holds is blocked, since the guard can't read it (cfg_check). The
# flags that name a program for a remote, --upload-pack, --receive-pack and --exec (clone's -u as well), are blocked on fetch,
# pull, push, clone, ls-remote and archive, and so is a prefix of their names, which git accepts (cfg_segment). The variables

# does (quotes, escapes, substitutions, comments, and the heredoc bodies gtext leaves out), so a quoted name (ba''sh) or a

#     Python can wait for console input there and never return. An empty body is only one shape of it (a quoted string that closes on a

#     blocked, with a time limit above it or not. It reads hbt a line at a time (py_line): a heredoc body a shell or an interpreter
#     runs stays in hbt, so a heredoc in the body of `bash <<'X'` is judged, and a message's body or an unrun cat body, which hang_strip
#     left out, isn't. In a line the quoted strings are blanked (a message that names the form is text, and an apostrophe in a comment
#     on an earlier line pairs with nothing), a quoted interpreter path ("C:/Program Files/Python313/python.exe") is its name, and a
#     comment is cut off. Only a Python that takes its script from standard input is blocked (py_stdin): a script file fed data from a
#     heredoc (`python tool.py <<'E'`), -c and -m pass. The interpreter is python, python3, python3.13, pythonw or py, with or without
#     .exe, in any case, behind a path or a wrapper (timeout, env, uv run); a command that only prints or searches its words (echo,
#     printf, grep) is text, and a name right after << is a heredoc's delimiter (<<PY). Nothing is read unless the command holds a << or
#     a PowerShell here-string and something spelled py, and then only the lines that spell py and hold a << (or close a here-string
#     with '@ |) are judged, so a long body costs two glob tests and one more per line.

# --- Comments (B51) -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A comment runs no command, but the rules still read its words, so an unquoted git command in one still blocks. What B51
# changed is that a comment's quotes can't pair with a quote after its line break: "it's" and the 'x' on the next line
# paired, so the refspec between them read as quoted text. cms and cme
# get each comment's start and end: a # that starts a word outside quotes and ${...} (cmt_start, B43), up to the line
# break. In Bash a backslash escapes the next character outside single quotes, $'...' escapes with a backslash, a $( is
# passed over as sub_end (B43) reads it, and a backtick span runs to its closing backtick. In PowerShell a backtick
# escapes the next character outside single quotes, quotes are doubled, and a # starts a comment after a blank, a line
# break, ; & | or (. A joined PowerShell reading has lost the backtick before a #, so a # there is judged as text too.
