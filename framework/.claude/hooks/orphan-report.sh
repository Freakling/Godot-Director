# Godot Director orphan report · Claude Code hook · framework-owned: replaced on upgrade.
#
# At session start, tells the human and Claude about long-running processes whose parent shell is gone, and leaves stopping
# them to the human: a subagent's or session's cleanup only reaches what a running session knows about, and a process from an
# ended session can spin a core for days unnoticed. A process is listed when its name is python, python3, python3.<n>, pythonw,
# py, node, bash, sh, godot* or chrome-headless-shell (any case, .exe dropped), it is an hour old or more, and its parent is
# gone: a ppid of 0 or 1, no process with that pid, or a parent younger than the process (Windows reuses pids and doesn't
# reparent). The oldest ten are named, with how many more there are. The list comes from PowerShell (Get-CimInstance
# Win32_Process, under timeout 8 when timeout exists) on Windows (Git Bash, MSYS, Cygwin) and from `ps -A -o pid=,ppid=,etime=,comm=`
# elsewhere. It reads the names, ids and ages of the processes on this machine and nothing else; it stores nothing, sends
# nothing and never stops, signals or changes a process; PRIVACY.md says what it reads. GODOT_DIRECTOR_ORPHAN_REPORT=0 turns it off.
# It prints one line of JSON, or nothing: a machine with no such process, or one whose process list can't be read (no
# PowerShell or ps, a tool that fails or times out), costs no context, and every path ends in exit 0, so it never blocks a
# session. A process name is reduced to [A-Za-z0-9._-] before it is printed, so it can't break the JSON. Bash 3.2 and BSD
# tools run it, and it starts as few processes as it can (uname and one process list, with timeout on Windows).
