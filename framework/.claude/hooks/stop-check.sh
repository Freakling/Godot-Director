# Godot Director Stop hook · Claude Code · framework-owned: replaced on upgrade.
#
# When Claude is about to finish a turn and this session wrote or edited a code, scene or data file since its
# last passing check, and code, scenes or data differ from the last commit, run the project check. The check
# itself skips work when nothing changed since its last pass. If the check fails, block once and hand the output
# back to Claude. The same failing state isn't reported twice, so a turn can still end after Claude has explained
# a failure it can't fix.
#
# Whether this session wrote such a file is session-touched.sh's record,
# .godot/godot-director/sessions/<session_id>.touched (the session_id is in the hook input). A session that
# edited only documentation has none, so it never waits for the check, even while another session in the same
# folder has uncommitted code. A record untouched for a day is deleted. A passing check removes the session's
# record, and so does a turn that ends with no such file differing from the last commit (the session's work is
# committed). With no session_id in the input (an older Claude Code), the hook decides from git alone: code,
# scenes or data differing from the last commit run the check.
# Turn it off per machine with GODOT_DIRECTOR_STOP_CHECK=0 (e.g. .claude/settings.local.json › env).
# It never runs in a prototype (bash tools/prototype.sh here).
